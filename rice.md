# RICE: A Defensive Primer

RICE is a framework that describes common psychological levers used in social engineering attacks. Understanding RICE helps employees recognize *how* they are being influenced, not just *what* is being asked.

RICE stands for:
- Reward
- Intimidation
- Convenience
- Ego

Attackers often combine multiple elements in a single interaction.

## Why RICE Matters

Most security guidance focuses on spotting suspicious content. RICE focuses on spotting **emotional manipulation**.

Strong emotional reactions reduce critical thinking. Recognizing these reactions early is one of the most effective defenses.

---

## Reward

Reward-based tactics promise personal or professional gain.

Common examples:
- Refunds, bonuses, or gift cards
- Free tools, templates, or “exclusive access”
- Messages stating “You’ve been selected”

What it sounds like:
- “You qualify for…”
- “Limited-time opportunity”
- “Exclusive offer”

Defensive mindset:
- Legitimate rewards do not require urgency or secrecy
- Unexpected benefits should always be verified
- Free access is often the cost of entry for compromise

---

## Intimidation

Intimidation uses fear, authority, or consequences to force action.

Common examples:
- Threats of account suspension
- Claims of legal or compliance violations
- Messages implying personal fault or urgency

What it sounds like:
- “Failure to act will result in…”
- “Immediate action required”
- “Your account will be disabled”

Defensive mindset:
- Legitimate issues allow time for verification
- Fear is a signal to slow down
- No one should discourage you from confirming a request

---

## Convenience

Convenience-based tactics make unsafe actions feel easier than secure ones.

Common examples:
- “This will only take a minute”
- “I’ve already filled most of it out”
- Requests designed to bypass normal processes

What it sounds like:
- “Just send it here”
- “No need to log a ticket”
- “We’re trying to save time”

Defensive mindset:
- Security exists to prevent mistakes, not cause delays
- Shortcuts are common failure points
- If a process is being bypassed, ask why

---

## Ego

Ego-based tactics appeal to pride, trust, or importance.

Common examples:
- Flattery
- Claims that you were “personally selected”
- Framing the request as recognition or responsibility

What it sounds like:
- “You’re the only one who can handle this”
- “Leadership trusts you”
- “This is sensitive, don’t loop others in”

Defensive mindset:
- Isolation is a red flag
- Important actions should withstand review
- Trust increases the need for verification, not reduces it

---

## Using RICE Defensively

When you notice a strong emotional reaction:
- Excitement
- Fear
- Pride
- Urgency

Treat it as a **pause signal**.

Ask yourself:
- What emotion is being triggered?
- Which RICE element is being used?
- What would verification look like right now?

---

## Key Takeaway

RICE-based attacks succeed by influencing how you feel, not by convincing you logically. Awareness of emotional pressure is a powerful security control.

Slowing down, verifying, and involving others are signs of professionalism, not hesitation.
