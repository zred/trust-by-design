# Social Engineering Techniques and Pretexts

Social engineering is the use of deception, manipulation, or psychological pressure to convince people to bypass normal security controls. Unlike technical attacks, social engineering targets human behavior: trust, urgency, helpfulness, and authority.

In an automotive marketing environment, attackers are often attempting to gain:
- Login credentials (email, CRM, ad platforms, dealer portals)
- Access to internal files or shared drives
- Payment changes or invoice approvals
- Sensitive client or campaign data

These attacks are common, persistent, and increasingly sophisticated.

## Why Social Engineering Works

Social engineering succeeds because it exploits normal workplace behaviors:
- Wanting to be helpful
- Responding quickly to urgent requests
- Trusting familiar brands, vendors, or coworkers
- Deferring to authority or seniority
- Avoiding friction or embarrassment

Security awareness is not about suspicion; it is about **verification**.

## Common Pretexts (False Scenarios)

A *pretext* is a fabricated story designed to make a request seem reasonable and legitimate.

### IT / Technical Support

Attackers pose as internal or external IT support to obtain credentials or install malicious software.

Common examples:
- Requests to “verify” or “reset” your password
- Claims that your account was flagged or compromised
- Requests to install updates, browser extensions, or remote tools
- Requests to log in to a “temporary” or “replacement” system

What to remember:
- IT will not ask for your password.
- Urgency is often artificial.
- Unexpected support requests should be verified using known internal channels.

---

### Authority Figures

Attackers impersonate individuals or organizations with perceived power.

Examples:
- Executives requesting urgent action “while in a meeting”
- Managers asking for files or credentials outside normal process
- Legal, regulatory, or compliance officials requesting records
- Law enforcement requesting cooperation without formal notice

What to remember:
- Authority does not override verification.
- Executives expect security procedures to be followed.
- Legitimate regulators do not demand immediate, informal action.

---

### Vendors and Service Providers

Marketing organizations rely heavily on third parties, which makes vendor impersonation especially effective.

Examples:
- Ad platform or CRM “support” contacting you directly
- Vendors requesting payment detail changes
- Creative or analytics partners asking for login access
- Delivery or maintenance personnel requesting physical access

What to remember:
- Vendors should already know established processes.
- Changes to payment or access require secondary verification.
- Familiar logos and email signatures can be forged.

---

### Emergency Situations

Attackers often create pressure to bypass normal checks.

Examples:
- Claims of account suspension or campaign shutdown
- “Last-chance” payment or approval requests
- Claims that delays will cause financial or reputational harm
- Requests framed as helping someone in distress

What to remember:
- Emergencies reduce critical thinking.
- Real emergencies can withstand verification.
- Slowing down is a security control, not a failure.

## Common Social Engineering Techniques

### Phishing

Fraudulent emails or messages designed to trick recipients into clicking links, opening attachments, or providing information.

Includes:
- Email phishing
- SMS phishing (smishing)
- Messaging app phishing (Teams, Slack, WhatsApp)

Common signs:
- Unexpected requests
- Misspelled domains or altered sender addresses
- Generic greetings or unusual tone
- Links that do not match the visible text

---

### Pretexting

A structured lie designed to build credibility over time.

Examples:
- Referencing real employees or campaigns
- Using information scraped from LinkedIn or company websites
- Continuing conversations across multiple messages

---

### Baiting

Enticing targets with something appealing.

Examples:
- Free tools, templates, or reports
- USB drives left in offices or parking areas
- “Exclusive” access to performance data or insights

---

### Tailgating / Piggybacking

Gaining physical access by following authorized personnel.

Examples:
- Someone asking you to hold a door
- Claiming a badge was forgotten or lost
- Wearing clothing that implies legitimacy

---

### Quid Pro Quo

Offering help or benefits in exchange for access.

Examples:
- “I’ll fix this issue if you log in for me”
- “I just need a quick screenshot”
- “This will only take a minute”

---

### Impersonation

Assuming the identity of a trusted individual or organization.

Includes:
- Email display-name spoofing
- Look-alike domains
- AI-generated voice or video impersonation

---

### Urgency and Pressure

Artificial time constraints designed to short-circuit normal judgment.

Common phrases:
- “Right now”
- “Immediately”
- “Before the end of the day”
- “This can’t wait”

---

### Authority Exploitation

Using hierarchy or fear to suppress questioning.

Indicators:
- Discouraging verification
- Framing questions as insubordination
- Emphasizing consequences of delay

---

### Familiarity Building

Establishing rapport before making a request.

Examples:
- Casual conversation
- Referencing internal projects or people
- Gradually escalating requests

---

## What You Should Do

When encountering **any** unexpected request involving access, credentials, payments, or sensitive data:

1. **Pause**
   - Do not respond immediately.
   - Urgency is a common manipulation tactic.

2. **Verify**
   - Use known contact information.
   - Start a new message or call, do not reply directly.

3. **Escalate**
   - Report suspicious requests according to company policy.
   - Early reporting protects everyone.

4. **Do Not Self-Correct**
   - If you clicked or responded, report it immediately.
   - Speed of reporting matters more than avoiding embarrassment.

---

## Cultural Expectations

Security is a shared responsibility.

- You are **allowed** to say no.
- You are **expected** to verify.
- You will **not** be penalized for slowing down to confirm.
- Attackers succeed when people feel rushed, isolated, or embarrassed.

---

## Key Takeaway

Social engineering attacks do not rely on technical skill. They rely on normal human behavior under pressure. Awareness, verification, and communication are the most effective defenses.
