# Layering

**Layering** is about building safety nets—not walls.  The goal isn’t to
restrict everything; it’s to contain damage when trust fails【367174366677757†L231-L241】.

## Build in safety nets

* Limit each tool’s access to only what it truly needs【367174366677757†L235-L236】.
* Use role‑based access control and disable stale accounts【367174366677757†L236-L237】.
* Keep production, staging and testing environments separated【367174366677757†L236-L238】.
* Review and remove unused apps or privileges regularly【367174366677757†L237-L239】.

> Layering isn’t about restriction—it’s about containment when trust fails【367174366677757†L240-L241】.

Implementing layers of defense reduces the blast radius of any single failure
and makes your overall system more robust.
