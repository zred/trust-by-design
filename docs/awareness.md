# Awareness

The first pillar of Trust by Design is **Awareness**.  You can’t protect what
you don’t know you’re using, so start by cataloging every tool, plugin or
script that touches your data【367174366677757†L205-L213】.

## Know what you’re using

* Treat every tool, plugin, or script as part of your attack surface【367174366677757†L209-L210】.
* Keep a running inventory of tools – yes, even browser extensions【367174366677757†L209-L211】.
* Ask: what data does this tool access?  Who maintains it?  Can we verify
  that it’s still working the way we expect【367174366677757†L211-L213】?

> If you don’t understand how it works, you can’t confirm it’s safe【367174366677757†L214-L215】.

Understanding and documenting the technologies you depend on allows you to
identify risks early and respond quickly when things change.
