# Trust But Confirm

The final principle is to **trust but confirm**.  Trust is extended
generously—but it must be verified routinely【367174366677757†L259-L268】.

## Record and revisit trust decisions

* Record trust decisions: why it was trusted, when and under what
  assumptions【367174366677757†L259-L264】.
* Schedule trust reviews as part of your workflows—quarterly or per
  campaign【367174366677757†L265-L266】.
* If a tool or vendor drifts from the original terms of trust, re‑evaluate or
  revoke【367174366677757†L266-L268】.

> Confirmation is a signal of confidence—not suspicion【367174366677757†L269-L270】.

By documenting and periodically re‑confirming trust, you maintain
accountability and adapt to changes in tools or processes.
