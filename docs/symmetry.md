# ⚖️ Symmetry

**Symmetry** reminds us that trust should be earned by everyone—not assumed
because of a brand name or convenience.  Vet all tools and vendors using the
same questions and criteria【367174366677757†L218-L225】.

## Apply consistent vetting

* Evaluate every tool, vendor and internal project with the same checklist【367174366677757†L218-L225】.
* Don’t assume safety based on brand, region or convenience【367174366677757†L222-L224】.
* If it touches data, it deserves a check—no matter how small, fast or "free"
  it feels【367174366677757†L223-L225】.

> Trust isn’t based on reputation. It’s based on confirmation【367174366677757†L227-L228】.

By applying the same standards to every component, you avoid blind spots and
build a culture of fairness and accountability.
