# ♻️ Resilience

**Resilience** means assuming that something trusted will eventually break and
designing for that possibility【367174366677757†L244-L253】.  How quickly you can
revoke, rebuild and recover determines how well you can weather incidents.

## Plan for failure

* Implement kill switches to revoke access quickly【367174366677757†L248-L249】.
* Use deterministic builds and versioned infrastructure to speed recovery【367174366677757†L248-L250】.
* Document reconfirmation intervals for key tools—trust decays unless
  refreshed【367174366677757†L249-L251】.
* Prepare your team for what to do after trust is broken: fallback access,
  communication plans and restoration paths【367174366677757†L251-L253】.

> Resilience means trust has a Plan B【367174366677757†L255-L256】.

Building resilience reduces downtime and panic when things go wrong and helps
you learn from disruptions rather than be derailed by them.
