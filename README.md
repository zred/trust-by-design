# Trust by Design

**Trust by Design** is a lightweight security framework that helps modern teams
evaluate, record and revisit the trust decisions they make every day.
In many organizations, "security" is often seen as IT’s responsibility.  In
reality, every new tool—whether it’s a campaign platform, analytics add‑on,
AI assistant or even a shared spreadsheet—is a trust decision【367174366677757†L196-L201】.  Trust by
Design provides a practical structure for making those decisions transparent
and repeatable.

This repository integrates the original project wiki into version‑controlled
markdown files so teams can collaborate on updates and reuse the material in
their own documentation.  See the [`docs/`](./docs/) folder for the
individual sections.

## Core Principles

Trust by Design is organized around a handful of simple but powerful
principles:

| Principle            | Summary |
|----------------------|---------|
| **Awareness**        | Know what you’re using and what it exposes【367174366677757†L205-L213】.  Treat every plugin or script as part of your attack surface, maintain an inventory and understand the data flows. |
| **⚖️ Symmetry**      | Apply the same vetting to every tool and vendor【367174366677757†L218-L225】.  Don’t assume safety based on brand or convenience; trust must be earned. |
| **Layering**         | Build in safety nets rather than walls【367174366677757†L231-L239】.  Limit access to only what’s needed, use role‑based permissions and separate environments. |
| **♻️ Resilience**     | Assume something trusted will break and plan for it【367174366677757†L244-L253】.  Implement kill switches, deterministic builds and document how to recover. |
| **Trust But Confirm**| Extend trust generously but verify routinely【367174366677757†L259-L268】.  Record why something was trusted, schedule regular reviews and be ready to revoke access if assumptions change. |

## Getting Started

Each section of the framework is stored as a standalone markdown file under
`docs/`.  Use these files as starting points for your own internal wikis,
training materials or decision logs.

If you’re contributing, follow the guidance in
[`docs/style_guide.md`](docs/style_guide.md) to ensure consistent voice,
tone and formatting【699030887059744†L200-L217】【699030887059744†L253-L266】.
