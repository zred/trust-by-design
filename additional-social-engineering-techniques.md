# Additional Social Engineering Tactics

This document covers social engineering tactics that are less obvious than phishing but are commonly used in real-world attacks. These techniques often exploit curiosity, routine behavior, or environmental trust rather than direct deception.

These tactics are especially effective in office, hybrid, and vendor-heavy environments.

## Littering (Malicious Seeding)

Littering involves deliberately placing items where employees are likely to find them, relying on curiosity or goodwill.

Common examples:
- USB drives left in parking lots, lobbies, or break rooms
- Printed documents labeled “Payroll,” “Confidential,” or “Urgent”
- QR codes posted on walls, elevators, or shared spaces
- Business cards with instructions to “visit this site for details”

Why it works:
- Physical objects feel safer than digital messages
- People want to help return lost items
- Curiosity overrides caution

Risks:
- USB devices can automatically install malware
- QR codes may lead to fake login pages
- Printed materials can redirect to attacker-controlled contacts

What to do:
- Do not plug in unknown devices
- Do not scan QR codes from unverified sources
- Report found items to IT or facilities

## Cloning (Visual or Message Duplication)

Cloning is the act of copying legitimate communications, websites, or documents and making subtle changes to redirect victims.

Common examples:
- Emails that closely resemble real vendor invoices
- Fake login pages that visually match real platforms
- Copied email threads with a malicious link inserted
- Duplicate websites with slightly altered domain names

Why it works:
- Familiarity lowers suspicion
- Visual accuracy creates false confidence
- People focus on content, not technical details

Risks:
- Credential theft
- Unauthorized access to CRM, email, or ad platforms
- Financial fraud via payment redirection

What to do:
- Check sender addresses and domains carefully
- Avoid clicking links in unexpected messages
- Use saved bookmarks to access known services

## Environmental Trust Exploitation

Environmental trust exploitation relies on surroundings and context to appear legitimate.

Examples:
- Wearing branded clothing or badges
- Using industry-specific language
- Referencing real coworkers, vendors, or campaigns
- Entering offices or meetings without being challenged

Why it works:
- Context signals legitimacy
- People assume others have already verified access

What to do:
- Verify access even if it feels uncomfortable
- Challenge politely and escalate when unsure
- Remember verification protects both people and systems

## Conversation Hijacking

Conversation hijacking occurs when attackers insert themselves into real conversations after gaining partial access.

Examples:
- Compromised email accounts replying mid-thread
- Payment instructions changed late in an exchange
- “Updated” attachments replacing original files

Why it works:
- Trust is inherited from the original conversation
- Changes feel routine and procedural

What to do:
- Treat changes to payment or access as high risk
- Verify changes using a second communication channel
- Be cautious of “updated” or “corrected” attachments

## Key Reminder

Social engineering does not need to look suspicious to be dangerous. The more normal something feels, the more important verification becomes.
